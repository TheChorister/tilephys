explosion debris (esp. for player)
weapons/ammo
* ammo pickups
more tiles
loading/top-level flow stuff:
* preloader that actually reports what it's loading
* avoid reloading sprites
* progress from one level to another
more general sprite handling?
nicer text rendering
nice script debug output/tidy up console output
better error handling in general
rewrite scripting layer?
optimisations:
* investigate speeding up move_body
* trivial optimisation of projectile::find_collision_pos
