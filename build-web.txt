cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
wasm-bindgen --target web --out-dir dist target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/princess-robot.wasm

edit dist/princess-robot.js as follows:

delete this line:
import * as __wbg_star0 from 'env';

add this after 'let wasm;':
export const set_wasm = (w) => wasm = w;

replace this line:
imports["env"] = __wbg_star0;
with this:
return imports.wbg;

replace every occurence of:
const imports = getImports();
with:
return getImports();

If anything changes, may need to update the checked in copy of princess-robot.js as described here:
